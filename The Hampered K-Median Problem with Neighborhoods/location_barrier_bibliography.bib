	abstract = {The travelling salesman problem (TSP) with neighbourhoods extends the TSP to the case where each vertex of the tour is allowed to move in a given region. This NP-hard optimization problem has recently received increasing attention in several technical fields such as robotics, unmanned aerial vehicles, or utility management. In this paper, the problem is formulated as a non-convex mixed-integer nonlinear programme (MINLP) having the property that fixing all the integer variables to any integer values yield a convex nonlinear programme. This property is used to modify the global MINLP optimizer Couenne, improving by orders of magnitude its performance and allowing the exact solution of instances large enough to be useful in applications. Computational results are presented where neighbourhoods are either polyhedra or ellipsoids in ℝ2 or ℝ3 and with the Euclidean norm as distance metric.},

	abstract = {As the generalization of TSP (Travelling Salesman Problem), TSPN (TSP with Neighborhoods) is closely related to several important real-world applications. However, TSPN is significantly more challenging than TSP as it is inherently a mixed optimization task containing both combinatorial and continuous components. Different from previous studies where TSPN is either tackled by approximation algorithms or formulated as a mixed integer problem, we present a hybrid framework in which metaheuristics and classical TSP solvers are combined strategically to produce high quality solutions for TSPN with arbitrary neighborhoods. The most distinctive feature of our solution is that it imposes no explicit restriction on the shape and size of neighborhoods, while many existing TSPN solutions require the neighborhoods to be disks or ellipses. Furthermore, various continuous optimization algorithms and TSP solvers can be conveniently adopted as necessary. Experiment results show that, using two off-the-shelf routines and without any specific performance tuning efforts, our method can efficiently solve TSPN instances with up to 25 regions, which are represented by both convex and concave random polygons.},

	abstract = {In a second-order cone program (SOCP) a linear function is minimized over the intersection of an affine set and the product of second-order (quadratic) cones. SOCPs are nonlinear convex problems that include linear and (convex) quadratic programs as special cases, but are less general than semidefinite programs (SDPs). Several efficient primal-dual interior-point methods for SOCP have been developed in the last few years. After reviewing the basic theory of SOCPs, we describe general families of problems that can be recast as SOCPs. These include robust linear programming and robust least-squares problems, problems involving sums or maxima of norms, or with convex hyperbolic constraints. We discuss a variety of engineering applications, such as filter design, antenna array weight design, truss design, and grasping force optimization in robotics. We describe an efficient primal-dual interior-point method for solving SOCPs, which shares many of the features of primal-dual interior-point methods for linear programming (LP): Worst-case theoretical analysis shows that the number of iterations required to solve a problem grows at most as the square root of the problem size, while numerical experiments indicate that the typical number of iterations ranges between 5 and 50, almost independent of the problem size.},

	abstract = {Python is a simple, yet powerful, interpreted programming language that bridges the gap between C and shell programming, and is thus ideally suited for ``throw-away programming'' and rapid prototyping. Its syntax is put together from constructs borrowed from a variety of other languages; most prominent are influences from ABC, C, Modula-3 and Icon. The Python interpreter is easily extended with new functions and data types implemented in C.  Python is also suitable as an extension language for highly customizable C applications such as editors or window managers. Python is available for various operating systems, amongst which several flavors of UNIX (including Linux), the Apple Macintosh O.S., MS-DOS, MS-Windows 3.1, Windows NT, and OS/2. This reference manual describes the syntax and ``core semantics'' of the language.  It is terse, but attempts to be exact and complete. The semantics of non-essential built-in object types and of the built-in functions and modules are described in the Python Library Reference.  For an informal introduction to the language, see the Python Tutorial.},

As the reader may guess, this question is a rhetoric one - sure it would be niee to have such a book, and many who want to leam about the subject or teach corresponding courses in university departments of mathematics, man­ agement science, computer science, geography, civil engineering, etc. would be likely users of such a book. Practitioners who want to find out, whether one of their problems can be solved with one of the location tools would love to get a quiek overview of what is available in this area. Researchers could use the book to check whether there is any new literat ure on a location subject they would want to work on. This book is an attempt to satisfy this wish list.

This problem models the design of routes of drones or other vehicles that must visit a number of geographical elements to deliver some good or service and then move directly to the next using straight line displacements. We present two families of mathematical programming formulations. The first one is time-dependent and captures a number of characteristics of real applications at the price of using three indexes variables. The second family of formulations is not time-dependent, instead it uses connectivity properties to ensure the proper definition of routes. We compare them on a testbed of instances with different shapes of elements: second order cone (SOC) representable and polyhedral neighborhoods and polygonal chains. The computational results reported in this paper show that our models are useful and our formulations can solve to optimality medium size instances of sizes similar to other combinatorial problems including neighborhoods that have already been studied in the literature. To address larger instances we also present a heuristic algorithm that runs in two phases: clustering and Variable Neighborhood Search. This algorithm performs very well since it provides promising feasible solutions and, in addition, it can be used to initialize the solvers with feasible solutions.},

The heuristic approach outlined in this paper appears to offer significant advantages in the solution of this class of problems in that it (1) provides considerable flexibility in the specification (modeling) of the problem to be solved, (2) can be used to study large-scale problems, that is, complexes with several hundred potential warehouse sites and several thousand shipment destinations, and (3) is economical of computer time. The results obtained in applying the program to small scale problems have been equal to or better than those provided by the alternative methods considered.},

	abstract = {The problem of computing shortest paths in obstacle environments has received considerable attention recently. We study this problem for a new metric that generalizes the L1 metric and the link metric. In this combined metric, the length of a path is defined as its L1 length plus some non-negative constant C times the number of turns the path makes.},
