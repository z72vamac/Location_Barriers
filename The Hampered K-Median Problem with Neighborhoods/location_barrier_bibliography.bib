  abstract = {Rapid urban growth is becoming a serious problem in most developing countries. Tehran, the capital of Iran, stands out as a vibrant metropolitan area, facing uncontrolled urban expansion. Public authorities and decision makers require planning criteria regarding possible spatial developments. To monitor past developmental trends and to simulate emerging spatiotemporal patterns of urban growth, this research applies a geosimulation approach that couples agent-based modeling with multicriteria analysis (MCA) for the period between 1986 and 2006. To model the major determinants controlling urban development, three agent groups are defined, namely developer agents, government agents, and resident agents. The behaviors of each agent group are identified by qualitative surveys and are considered separately using multi-criteria analysis. The interactions of the agents are then combined through overlay functions within a Geographic Information System (GIS). This analysis results in the creation of a propensity surface of growth that is able to identify the most probable sites for urban development. Subsequently, a Markov Chain Model (MCM) and a concise statistical extrapolation are used to determine the amount of probable future expansion in Tehran. For validation purposes, the model is estimated using 2011 data and then validated based on actual urban expansion. Given the accurate predictions of the Markov Chain Model, further predictions were carried out for 2016 and 2026. This simulation provides strong evidence that during the next decade planning authorities will have to cope with continuous as well as heterogeneously distributed urban growth. Both the monitoring of growth and simulation revealed significant developments in the northwestern part of Tehran, continuing toward the south along the interchange networks.},

Instead, each of the facilities must be located in a region around their initially assigned location (the neighborhood). In this problem, two main decisions have to be made simultaneously: the determination of the potential facilities that must be open to serve the customers' demand and the location of the open facilities in their neighborhoods, at global minimum cost. We present several mixed integer non-linear programming formulations for a wide family of objective functions which are common in Location Analysis: ordered median functions. We also develop two math-heuristic approaches for solving the problem. We report the results of extensive computational experiments.},

Various geometrical problems are then presented, and there is detailed discussion of unconstrained and constrained minimization problems, and interior-point methods. The focus of the book is on recognizing convex optimization problems and then finding the most appropriate technique for solving them. It contains many worked examples and homework exercises and will appeal to students, researchers and practitioners in fields such as engineering, computer science, mathematics, statistics, finance and economics.},

It is assumed that a forbidden region is an area in the plane where travel and facility location are not permitted and that distance is measured using the Euclidean-distance metric. A solution procedure for this nonconvex programming problem is presented. It is shown that by iteratively solving a series of unconstrained problems, this procedure terminates at a local optimum to the original constrained problem. Numerical examples are presented.},

The Python interpreter is easily extended with new functions and data types implemented in C.  Python is also suitable as an extension language for highly customizable C applications such as editors or window managers. Python is available for various operating systems, amongst which several flavors of UNIX (including Linux), the Apple Macintosh O.S., MS-DOS, MS-Windows 3.1, Windows NT, and OS/2. This reference manual describes the syntax and ``core semantics'' of the language.  It is terse, but attempts to be exact and complete.

SOCPs are nonlinear convex problems that include linear and (convex) quadratic programs as special cases, but are less general than semidefinite programs (SDPs). Several efficient primal-dual interior-point methods for SOCP have been developed in the last few years. After reviewing the basic theory of SOCPs, we describe general families of problems that can be recast as SOCPs. These include robust linear programming and robust least-squares problems, problems involving sums or maxima of norms, or with convex hyperbolic constraints. We discuss a variety of engineering applications, such as filter design, antenna array weight design, truss design, and grasping force optimization in robotics. We describe an efficient primal-dual interior-point method for solving SOCPs, which shares many of the features of primal-dual interior-point methods for linear programming (LP): Worst-case theoretical analysis shows that the number of iterations required to solve a problem grows at most as the square root of the problem size, while numerical experiments indicate that the typical number of iterations ranges between 5 and 50, almost independent of the problem size.},

  abstract = {The flight planning for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is extremely useful both in terms of planimetry and altimetry. Regarding the planimetry, it is needed to reach and operate on the region of interest, while for the altimetry, it is functional to plan the flight altitude as function of the obstacles along the navigation path. In this paper we propose an innovative approach for the construction of a georeferenced map of the obstacles based on Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technologies. In this way the path planning for the UAV navigation can be accurately managed by defining precise flight plans on a cartographic support where the obstacles are represented in a three-dimensional way. The employment of free and open source software only, makes the approach widely usable and customizable.},

  abstract = {The problem of determining shortest paths through a weighted planar polygonal subdivision with n vertices is considered. Distances are measured according to a weighted Euclidean metric: The length of a path is defined to be the weighted sum of (Euclidean) lengths of the subpaths within each region. An algorithm that constructs a (restricted) ``shortest path map'' with respect to a given source point is presented. The output is a partitioning of each edge of the subdivion into intervals of {$\epsilon$}-optimality, allowing an {$\epsilon$}-optimal path to be traced from the source to any query point along any edge. The algorithm runs in worst-case time O(ES) and requires O(E) space, where E is the number of ``events'' in our algorithm and S is the time it takes to run a numerical search procedure. In the worst case, E is bounded above by O(n4) (and we give an {$\Omega$}(n4) lower bound), but it is likeky that E will be much smaller in practice. We also show that S is bounded by O(n4L), where L is the precision of the problem instance (including the number of bits in the user-specified tolerance {$\epsilon$}). Again, the value of S should be smaller in practice. The algorithm applies the ``continuous Dijkstra'' paradigm and exploits the fact that shortest paths obey Snell's Law of Refraction at region boundaries, a local optimaly property of shortest paths that is well known from the analogous optics model. The algorithm generalizes to the multi-source case to compute Voronoi diagrams.},

  abstract = {In this paper we deal with an extension of the crossing postman problem to design routes that have to visit different shapes of dimensional elements rather than edges. This problem models the design of routes of drones or other vehicles that must visit a number of geographical elements to deliver some good or service and then move directly to the next using straight line displacements. We present two families of mathematical programming formulations. The first one is time-dependent and captures a number of characteristics of real applications at the price of using three indexes variables. The second family of formulations is not time-dependent, instead it uses connectivity properties to ensure the proper definition of routes. We compare them on a testbed of instances with different shapes of elements: second order cone (SOC) representable and polyhedral neighborhoods and polygonal chains. The computational results reported in this paper show that our models are useful and our formulations can solve to optimality medium size instances of sizes similar to other combinatorial problems including neighborhoods that have already been studied in the literature. To address larger instances we also present a heuristic algorithm that runs in two phases: clustering and Variable Neighborhood Search. This algorithm performs very well since it provides promising feasible solutions and, in addition, it can be used to initialize the solvers with feasible solutions.},

  abstract = {As the generalization of TSP (Travelling Salesman Problem), TSPN (TSP with Neighborhoods) is closely related to several important real-world applications. However, TSPN is significantly more challenging than TSP as it is inherently a mixed optimization task containing both combinatorial and continuous components. Different from previous studies where TSPN is either tackled by approximation algorithms or formulated as a mixed integer problem, we present a hybrid framework in which metaheuristics and classical TSP solvers are combined strategically to produce high quality solutions for TSPN with arbitrary neighborhoods. The most distinctive feature of our solution is that it imposes no explicit restriction on the shape and size of neighborhoods, while many existing TSPN solutions require the neighborhoods to be disks or ellipses. Furthermore, various continuous optimization algorithms and TSP solvers can be conveniently adopted as necessary. Experiment results show that, using two off-the-shelf routines and without any specific performance tuning efforts, our method can efficiently solve TSPN instances with up to 25 regions, which are represented by both convex and concave random polygons.},
